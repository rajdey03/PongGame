package Ping_Pong;

/*This is a ping pong game simulator. 
 * Writing this code taught me about Event Handling, Collision Detection and Graphics Rendering.
 * 
 * Event Handling: This code uses action event handling to respond to specifically keyboard inputs. For this game, it was only handling paddle controls.
 * 
 * Collision Detection: This code helped me understand collision logic in code. This game had a very basic logic behind collision, 
 * as the only thing constantly changing is the ball's velocity.
 * 
 * Graphics Rendering: Probably the coolest one, using Java's AWT and Swing libraries, I learned how to draw static shapes and texts on a created screen.
 * 
 * AWT: provides classes for GUIs
 * Swing: Additional components for creating GUIs, like frames, buttons, etc.
 * awt.event: Event handling for both AWT and Swing*/
